Participatory Bayesian network,Technique,"A BN consists of two key components: (i) an influence diagram that describes underlying relationships in a system and (ii) a set of conditional probability tables, which define the quantitative relationships between each variable and its parents. Together, these components decompose a complex causal chain into a series of local relationships.<ul><li>Pearl, J. 2001. “Bayesian Networks, Causal Inference and Knowledge Discovery.” UCLA Cognitive Systems Laboratory, Technical Report.</li><li>Castelletti, A., Soncini-Sessa, R. 2007. “Bayesian Networks and Participatory Modelling in Water Resource Management.” Environmental Modelling & Software 22, no. 8: 1075–88.</li></ul>",medium,system dynamics - probabilities,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,reduce
Science and Technology Roadmapping,Technique,"Roadmapping is a method which outlines the future of a field of technology, generating a timeline for development of various interrelated technologies and (sometimes) including factors like regulatory and market structures. It is a technique widely used by high-tech industries, where it serves both as a tool for communication, exchange, and development of shared visions, and as a way of communicating expectations about the future to other parties. Roadmaps provide essential understanding of proximity, direction and some degree of certainty in planning. It is a normative and goal oriented method, where attempts are made to achieve a desired future state of development.<ul><li>Glenn, J., & Gordon, T. 2009. Futures Research Methodology. Version 3.0.

Heuristic Modeling,Technique,"Heuristic modeling consist of the use of (simplistic) models to better understand the problem, and to provoke dialogue. The core of the method is a simulation model – designed to be complementary to, and integrated with, a variety of other futures methods and to bridge between qualitative scenarios and quantitative modeling. The simplistic model component hepls to provoke discussion, pose questions, and implement a participatory process that is simple, straightforward, and with a fast learning curve.<ul><li>Glenn, J., & Gordon, T. 2009.

Visioning,Technique,"Visioning is the process of creating a series of images or visions of the future that are real and compelling enough to motivate and guide people toward focusing their efforts on achieving certain goals. The visioning process is almost always done in a participatory manner. The group of participants needs to include representation from key constituencies both inside and outside the organization or community. The meeting facilitator will need to set up the vision discussion by creating a good mental space for the sharing of values and aspirations.<ul><li>Glenn, J., & Gordon, T. 2009.

Wild Cards,Technique,"Wild cards are low-probability, high-impact events. This concept may be introduced into anticipatory decision-making activity in order to increase the ability of organizations and governments to adapt to surprises arising in turbulent (business) environments. Such sudden and unique incidents might constitute turning points in the evolution of a certain trend or system. Wild cards may or may not be announced by weak signals, which are incomplete and fragmented data from which foresight information might be inferred.<ul><li>Glenn, J., & Gordon, T. 2009.
